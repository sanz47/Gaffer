How to use this program:
  1. This program is offline based. So you need a local database named test installed in your computer. In the database folowing table need to be present: (login_table, manager_info, match_info, owner_info, physio_info, player_data, player_info)
  2. In the "login_table" you need to manually input your super user info(username ,password and user type-admin). This will enable you to create other users later.
